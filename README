= Deploying the Django Application =

You must define the MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL. MEDIA_ROOT must have read and
write access for the user that Django is run under. When using Django with
Apache, this user is usually www-data.

It is a really Good Idea (TM) to keep MEDIA_ROOT short. FASTA has a character
limit of 121 characters for file paths; the input and output to the FASTA
programs is saved under the MEDIA_ROOT in time-stamped directories. Thus, keep
MEDIA_ROOT short (e.g., '/var/jelesko/')

Below the MEDIA_ROOT, there must be two directories (also read-write-able by
the Django user): selects/ and searches/, to store selections and search
program outputs, respectively.
